I love to take my family out on picks, I want an easy way to find new places to take them so we can enjoy the fresh and new scenery together. 

As a young sporty teenager, I want to find convenient places to kick a footy with my mates. I need it to be big enough that we won't send the ball across the road or into someone's window.

I have four big huskies and need to find new parks to take them where I can let them off the leash and have them safely run around an enclosed environment. It would be great if the park was popular with other dogs so they can play together.

As A Football player,
I want to have enough room to kick a football and run around, I would also know if there is an exercise equipment so I can do a quick cardio session,
So I need to know there is a big oval with goals, water nearby if im running around and getting thirsty, and if im home late from school there will be lighting in the area.

As a dog owner,
I want to know if theres a facility around me to bring my dogs for a run, I would like a dog park. I work late some nights as well,
So I would like a good amount of room for my dog to run around and be in a fenced area with a few  ramps and jumps to practice. Also some lighting if its late and water for myself and my dog would be great. My dog runs and I take my bike, so some bike parking locally would be a major plus.

As a parent of 3 kids,
We are new to the area, and I need to know where a good parkland is nearby for my children, they are young and require them to have a fence around. They are kids that love water, so a water-park would be preferred. I have one kid with a disability and he has a wheel chair, so I require disabled parking and access with a wheel chair to the park area. As they are running around we would require water fountains and bathroom facilities with a shower.


# R5	Wireframes for multiple standard screen sizes, created using industry standard software
*Provide UX/UI design documentation(wireframes) that adequately show Agile methodology implementation.*

- For our wireframes, we used an application called Miro.
  It is a great app and users can work on the same project at the same time, and be able to download it later on in low quality mode for free for 3 instances. We found a lot of other applications not to be as easy to use and adequate for our needs.
